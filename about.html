Title of the project : Image Compression Website
Objective and Scope :
The main objective of the website is to provide compressed images without losing
quality.
The website will be designed to be used even by naive users. It will provide all the
necessary instructions required to operate on the website. The website will be designed
considering different types of users depending on age differences and various moods
of peoples visiting the website.
The website will work smoothly and effortlessly. Efforts will be made to decrease the
loading time of the website and image compression duration time as well. Uploading
and downloading of the image will go on smoothly without errors. Various image
formats will be supported by the website. Different functionalities will be used to secure
the website from malicious users and provide a limit to the image size so that website
performance is not affected.
Users will be asked to create their account on the website featuring them to save their
images in the website database. Confidentiality will be maintained in users to service
providing relationships so that users are benefitted to maximum.
Process Description:
The website will be developed from scratch using new technologies and designs
trending in the market.
Designing of the website and making the website to work i.e. Front-End and Back-End
will be worked on parallely to finish the work before deadline. They will be integrated
after being tested thoroughly on their ends.
Website will be designed using some of the Bootstrap templates. Required content will
be added to the website providing the naive user information how to operate the
website using HTML and extra designing and requirements will be satisfied using CSS.
Website responsiveness will be handled by JavaScript. Form will be made into a
function for uploading and downloading images.
To make the website function FLASK framework will come into action providing
algorithms to function in the website itself. The famous image compression algorithm
Huffman Encoding will be used to have image compression accurately without reducing
the quality of image and standards. Some good coding techniques and flask functions
will be used to limit the image size and provide security to the website so that users
cannot corrupt the website and affect the performance.
After the uploading of image is done successfully after verifying the image content
and its size in all aspects File Handling methods are used to use the uploaded image by
the algorithm to compress.
Login features will also be provided to the user so that each and every user can have
their personal database online to store compressed images so that they can be used
whenever required by them. The whole database of the user will be stored in the cloud
using some of the famous cloud techniques to increase robustness and accessibility.
PHP language will be used to make a login system and XAMPP server to maintain
record of users.
Resources and Limitations:
The hardware and software used in the project will be -
➔ Hardware
❖ 4 GB RAM or more
❖ x32-based processor or above
❖ basic input and output devices
➔ Software
❖ Windows XP and above or any other operating system
❖ Visual Studio Code (version 1.61)
❖ XAMPP Server
❖ phpMyAdmin 5.1.1
➔ Languages and Frameworks
❖ HTML 5
❖ CSS 3
❖ JavaScript ES2015
❖ Bootstrap 5.1.0
❖ Flask 2.0.2
❖ Python 3.9.0
❖ PHP 8.0.12
➔ Browser
❖ Google chrome
❖ Microsoft Edge
❖ Mozilla Firefox
❖ Safari
➔ Web Hosting
❖ GitHub
Conclusion:
The features of the project or the challenges to face are :-
● To make use of algorithm i.e. Huffman encoding practically
● Using uploaded images to function
● Verifying the uploaded images in every aspect i.e. size and format
● Implementing file handling concepts in real time
● Integrating python code with the website
● Reducing time complexity as much as possible
● Handling database of different users
